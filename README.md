# Satellite Command System

A Python program simulating a Satellite Command System for controlling a satellite's orientation, solar panel status, and data collection.

## Description

This project implements a simple command-line interface (CLI) for controlling a satellite's attributes, including orientation, solar panel status, and data collection. It provides a basic framework for simulating the behavior of a satellite in orbit.

## Features

- Initialize the satellite with default attributes.
- Rotate the satellite's orientation (North, South, East, West).
- Activate and deactivate solar panels.
- Collect data if solar panels are active.
- Transient error handling and logging for error messages.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/satellite-command-system.git

2. Run the program:
   python satellite.py

Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the simulated satellite.

3. Dependencies
Python 3.x
Logging module (for error logging)
